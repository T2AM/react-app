Talk To A Maintainer
====================
## _we really need a cute, clever tag_
## _something like_
## "Connect with the experts to get things done"

This thing uses:
----------------
### [React-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
[https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)

### [Foundation for Sites](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/)
[https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/)

### For now the data API is a static JSON file
The inimitable [Ben](https://github.com/bcoe) is writing a proper (Express?) API for us. Thx Ben!

All the work on this front-end thing so far has been done by [Colin](https://github.com/ckingbailey) so blame him

To run it:
----------
```shell
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
That up there is lazy documenting, I know. These docs will grow as the project grows (I promise).
